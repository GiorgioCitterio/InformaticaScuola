# Community Workshop Modules

Here you will find additional modules that build upon the completed workshop application that highlight different features and capabilities from the community. This may include how to implement new architecture, use a different testing framework, or integrate a third party control from the community or a control vendor. Each module is built to showcase a unique capability with .NET MAUI and the .NET ecosystem and can be completed standalone or when you finish the main workshop. These modules are maintained by the original author of the community module. If you run into an issue please open a new issue with the "Community Module Issue" on GitHub.

## Contributing Modules

So, you have an awesome library, component, or architecture pattern that you want to showcase in the .NET MAUI workshop? Then you are in the right place because you can contribute your very own community module right here! Before you do though, be sure to follow these instructions:

1. Open a new issue with your idea for the community module. This issue should outline what the module will be about, if their are any account creation requirements, and what the main steps of the module will be.
2. Once approved, work on your module and adhear to the same pattern as the main workshop giving developers are starting point and walking them through adding the functionality.
3. Ensure a slide deck is included with your module.
4. Create a PR with your module in the "Community Modules" folder.
5. Work with the workshop maintainers to get your PR approved and just like that your module will be live!

By creating a community module you are signing up to keep your module up to date with the latest versions of .NET MAUI, other 3rd party packages, and any other changes that may need to be adjusted over time. Failure to update a module or respond to feedback/issues on GitHub will result in your module being archived. If this all sounds good to you and you are ready to get rolling then open up that issue with your community module.
